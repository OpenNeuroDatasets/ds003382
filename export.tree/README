Monash vis-fPET-fMRI Dataset
============================

The Monash vis-fPET-fMRI dataset contains simultaneous FDG-fPET/BOLD-fMRI acquisitions from 10 young healthy individuals. The dataset comprises unreconstructed fPET list-mode data, as well as data reconstructed in 1-min bins.  The data was acquired using a flickering checkerboard embedded block design (Jamadar et al., 2019a), which allows the examination of a task-evoked signal with known timecourse in a localised region-of-interest. This design is particularly suitable for development of novel processing and analysis pipelines. The release of unreconstructed and reconstructed data acquired during task-evoked visual cortex activation provides significant re-use value. Examples of re-use may include disentangling the glucose metabolic and blood oxygenation level dependent responses to neuronal activity (Jamadar et al., 2019a; Shokri-Kojori et al., 2019), synergistic data reconstruction (Sudarshan et al., 2020; Ovtchinnikov et al., 2020) and fusion techniques (Shenpeng’s mICA), novel multimodal attenuation correction procedures (Baran et al., 2018), and refinement of fPET-fMRI processing pipelines (Li et al., 2020; Jamadar et al., 2020a).

(IMPORTANT: Please note that the UTE, Dixon, 1 minute reconstructed PET data and unconstracted PET listmode data) are not compatible with the current BIDS specifications. They are in the corresponding directories:
* UTE: /sub-*/ute
* Dixon: /sub-*/dixon
* Reconstrcuted PET: /sub-*/pet
* listmode data: /sourcedata/sub-*/pet

The entire dataset is about 85GB in size,including MRI images (3.51 GB), and PET-related images and data (~81GB).
